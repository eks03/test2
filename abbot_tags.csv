7,"I use the Dexcom G6 app and its companion, Clarity. I do use the primary app (Dexcom G6) many times a day, though. However, I have only been using them for about a month. Using a CGM is life-changing for me... it is amazing to have that information at my fingertips (no pun intended)... but I am not sure if I like Dexcom better than Freestyle. I used Freestyle for a couple of years and really appreciated how easy it was to see the various charts and graphs of what my sugars had been doing over the days/weeks/months, how they varied with time of day, and so on. I *think* all of that information is also available with Dexcom's Clarity app, but I have to ask for specific reports, etc. It is not as easy or intuitive. However, I think that with a little more time, I will be able to get everything I need from the Dexcom apps. I am not certain what app I would like to see... perhaps a combination of the Freestyle (with its easy graphs) and the Dexcom (with its constant readings). In addition, it would be helpful to be able to personalize allmof the alarms and notifications on the Dexcom. Aside from CGMs, I cannot think of other apps that would be helpful. Perhaps an app that offered easy access to net carbs in various servings of foods? (Such an apps probably already exists if I hunt for it.) I have never heard of OnDuo, Levels, or January.

Currently, I just use the Garmin app that works with my Garmin watch to track my steps, activity levels, amount of nightly sleep, and water intake. So it is not specifically geared toward diabetes management, but it helps with monitoring factors that could contribute to good or poor glucose control. I look at the app everyday to every other day so I can see the big picture with regards to my health. I really like the interface of this app and would like to see diabetes-related info integrated into it. I guess that would mean being able to see my glucose level on my watch at any given moment because I would prefer to not carry my monitor and/or phone while exercising.
